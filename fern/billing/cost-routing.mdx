During calls, requests will be made to different providers in the voice pipeline:

- **transcription providers:** providers conducting speech-to-text
- **model providers:** LLM providers
- **voice providers:** providers conducting text-to-speech
- **telephony providers:** providers like [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)/[Vonage](https://www.vonage.com) that facilitate phone calls

<Info>
  Per-minute telephony costs only occur during inbound/outbound phone calling. Web calls do not
  incur this cost.

## Where Provider Costs End-up

There are 2 places these charges can end up:

1. **Provider-side:** in the account you have with the provider.
2. **With Vapi:** in your Vapi account.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Billed Provider-side" icon="washing-machine" iconType="solid" defaultOpen={true}>
    If we have [provider keys](customization/provider-keys) on file for a provider, the cost will be seen directly
    in your account with the provider. Vapi will have made the request on your behalf with your provider key.

    No charge will be made to your Vapi account.

    Charges for inbound/outbound phone calling (telephony) will always end up where the phone number
    was provisioned. If you import a phone number from Twilio or Vonage, per-minute charges for calling
    those numbers will appear with them.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Billed with Vapi" icon="v" iconType="solid" defaultOpen={true}>
    If no key is found on-file for the provider, Vapi will make the API request itself (with Vapi's own keys, at Vapi's expense). This expense is then passed on [**at-cost**](/glossary#at-cost) to be billed directly to your Vapi account.

    No charge will show up provider-side.

## Billing That "Just Works"

The central idea is that everything is designed to "just work".

Whether you are billed provider-side, or on Vapi's side, you will never be charged with any margin for provider fees incurred during calls.
