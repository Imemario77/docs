1. **Per-Artifact Storage Routing in [Artifact Plans](https://api.vapi.ai/api#:~:text=ArtifactPlan)**: You can now override artifact storage behavior per assistant/call for SIP packet capture (PCAP), logging, and call recording artifacts:

- `Assistant.artifactPlan.pcapUseCustomStorageEnabled` (default true): Use custom storage for SIP packet capture, which are stored in `Assistant.artifactPlan.pcapUrl`.
- `Assistant.artifactPlan.loggingUseCustomStorageEnabled` (default true): Determines whether to use your custom storage (S3 or GCP) for call logs when storage credentials are configured; set to false to store logs on Vapi's storage for this assistant, even if custom storage is set globally.
- `Assistant.artifactPlan.recordingUseCustomStorageEnabled` (default true): Determines whether to use your custom storage (S3 or GCP) for call recordings when storage credentials are configured; set to false to store recordings on Vapi's storage for this assistant, even if custom storage is set globally.
