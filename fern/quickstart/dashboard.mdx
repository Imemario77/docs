## Overview

Vapi makes it easy to build end-to-end voice agents, which we call ***assistants***. Assistants support live, two-way conversations. You can call an assistant or have it call you. 

**Each assistant has three components:** Speech-to-text (STT), Language model (LLM) and Text-to-speech (TTS). Vapi gives you full control over each, with dozens of providers and models to choose from.

**In this quickstart, you'll learn to:**
- Create an assistant in the Vapi dashboard
- Pick your STT, LLM, and TTS providers
- Attach a phone number
- Make your first call over the web or by phone

## Prerequisites

- [A Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)

## Get started by creating an assistant

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
        Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Your Assistant">
        In the Vapi dashboard, create a new assistant using the customer support specialist template.

        </Frame>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your assistant">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="First message">
            Set the first message that the assistant will speak when a conversation is started with it.

            ```plaintext First message
            Hi there, this is Alex from TechSolutions customer support. How can I help you today?
            ```
          </Step>

          <Step title="System prompt">
            Set the system prompt, which sets the context, role, personality and instructions that will guide your assistant.

            ```plaintext System Prompt
            You are Alex, a customer service voice assistant for TechSolutions. Your primary purpose is to help customers resolve issues with their products, answer questions about services, and ensure a satisfying support experience.
            - Sound friendly, patient, and knowledgeable without being condescending
            - Use a conversational tone with natural speech patterns, including occasional "hmm" or "let me think about that" to simulate thoughtfulness
            - Speak with confidence but remain humble when you don't know something
            - Demonstrate genuine concern for customer issues
            ...
            ```
          </Step>
        </Steps>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure the models for your assistant">
        <Steps>
          <Step title="Set the LLM (large language model)">
            Select your preferred provider and the large language model (LLM) that will power your assistant (default gpt-4o).

            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-llm.png" />
            </Frame>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Set the transcriber (speech-to-text) model">
            In the transcriber tab, choose the transcriber (speech-to-text, STT) model that will convert your callers' speech into text for your assistant to process.

            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-transcriber.png" />
            </Frame>

            <Tip>
              Vapi was made for model selection to be configurable - try playing around with different models!
            </Tip>
          </Step>

          <Step title="Choose the voice (text-to-speech) model">
            In the voice tab, select the voice (TTS) model that will determine how your assistant sounds to callers.
            
            <Frame>
              <img src="../static/images/quickstart/dashboard/set-voice.png" />
            </Frame>

            Just like with the transcriber, you can plug in any provider!
          </Step>

          Web SDK creates browser-based calls. For phone calls, use Server SDK APIs.
