## Introduction

Workflows is a visual builder designed for creating robust, deterministic conversation flows. It empowers developers and low-code builders to design agents through an intuitive interface representing interactions via nodes and edges.

## Key benefits

* **Visual conversation builder** - Easily prototype and demonstrate conversation flows visually
* **Complex flow management** - Ideal for scenarios with numerous interaction paths, such as call centers, customer support, appointment scheduling, and onboarding processes
* **Reliable determinism** - Offers stronger control compared to single-prompt Assistants, ensuring predictable conversational paths even in highly complex flows
* **Developer-focused flexibility** - Fully configurable via API, enabling selection of models, transcribers, and voices available throughout the Vapi platform

## Common use patterns

* **User intent manager** - Route user interactions based on specific intents
* **Human escalation paths** - Allow users to transfer to human agents at any workflow stage
* **Customer-specific flows** - Differentiate workflows based on user profiles, such as new versus existing customers

## Workflows structure

Workflows consist of nodes and edges. There are multiple types of nodes and a Workflow must have a start node, which is the main entry point for the conversation flow. 

By default a Conversation Node is the start node, but it can be changed to a different type of node. Start nodes cannot be deleted and a Workflow must have exactly one.

## Node types

### Conversation Node

The Conversation Node is the default type of node. It's highly configurable and it's the main building block for conversation flows.

#### Configuration options

* **First Message** - Specify the initial spoken message when entering the node
* **Prompt** - Provide detailed instructions guiding agent responses and conversation direction
* **Global Node** - Allows routing to this node from any point in the workflow
* **Model/Voice/Transcriber Settings** - Individually configure AI model, voice, and transcription services per node
* **Extract Variables** - Gather variables from conversation using liquid syntax `{{ variable_name }}`

#### Variable extraction

Variables can be configured by:
* Defining variable name and data type (String, Number, Boolean, Integer)
* Writing a clear extraction prompt describing what data to extract
* Setting enums for String-type variables to constrain values to a specific set

### API Request Node

The API Request Node allows developers to make HTTP requests to their API, custom endpoints, or automation services like Make, n8n, or Zapier. 

* Configure GET and POST requests
* Request bodies must be formatted in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)
* Body UI builder automatically handles JSON Schema formatting

### Transfer Call Node

Transfer calls to another phone number, including human agents or specialized voice agents.

* Specify a phone number destination
* Configure a [transfer plan](/call-forwarding#call-transfers-mode) to provide context to the receiving party
* Include a message or summary of the call before connecting

### End Call Node

Terminal node to end calls explicitly. Configure with an optional closing message (via the first message field) to users before termination.

<Warning>
Workflows without a defined End Call Node risk unintended minutes usage. Ensure all workflows have clear termination points to ensure the call eventually ends.
</Warning>

### Tool Node

Integrate existing Tools library functionalities. Select tools previously created for use within Workflows, maintaining consistency with Assistant configurations.

## Edges and conditions

A node is connected to another node via an edge. Developers can specify a condition (within the edge) that must be true for the conversation to flow from one node to the next.

### Types of conditions

**AI-based conditions** - Written in plain language and evaluated by LLMs:
```txt
User wants to talk about voice agents
```

**Logical conditions** - For precise control using variables:
```txt
{{ city == "San Francisco" }}
```

**Combined conditions** - Mix logical operators with variables:
```txt
{{ customer_tier == "VIP" or total_orders > 50 }}
```

### Best practices for conditions

* Use descriptive, natural language for AI-based conditions
* Extract variables as enums to enable reliable branching
* Test all conditional paths thoroughly
* Keep conditions simple and specific

## Best practices

### Planning and design

* **Map conversation flows first** - Plan all possible user journeys before building
* **Use descriptive node names** - Make workflows easier to understand and maintain
* **Handle edge cases** - Add global nodes for common scenarios like user confusion

### Implementation

* **Keep prompts focused** - Each node should have a single, clear purpose
* **Test thoroughly** - Use the built-in calling feature to test all conversation paths
* **Use variables strategically** - Extract only necessary information and use it to personalize conversations

### Optimization

* **Monitor performance** - Review call logs and analytics to optimize workflows over time
* **Plan for scale** - Consider how workflows will perform with high call volumes
* **Version control** - Keep track of workflow changes and test before deploying
