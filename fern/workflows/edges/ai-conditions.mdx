## Overview

AI Conditions use artificial intelligence to decide the next step in your workflow based on the conversation. Instead of using fixed rules, they can understand complex situations and make smart decisions in real-time.

## How It Works

1. The AI looks at the conversation history and context
2. It makes a smart decision about which path to take, based on variables collected from Gather verbs and data returned from API requests.
3. Works alongside your existing rules for maximum flexibility


## Configuration
- **Condition Node:** Start by inserting a condition node into your workflow.
- **Branch Setup:** Attach one or more nodes to the condition node.
- **AI Tag:** Click on the connecting edge and choose `AI` from the `Condition Type` dropdown
- **AI Condition** Use the input to define when the chosen branch should be taken.

## Usage

Use AI Conditions when you need:
- To handle unclear or complex user responses
- More flexibility than traditional rules can provide
- More natural, human-like conversations
