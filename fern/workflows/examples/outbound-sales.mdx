## Overview

Build an AI-powered outbound sales workflow that qualifies leads, handles objections, and schedules appointments using Vapi workflows with sophisticated branching logic and CRM integration.

**What You'll Build:**
* Lead qualification with BANT scoring and conditional routing

## 1. Create a Knowledge Base

    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/outbound-sales/leads.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download leads.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/outbound-sales/products.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download products.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../../static/spreadsheets/outbound-sales/call_outcomes.csv">
        <Button intent="primary">Download call_outcomes.csv</Button>
      </Download>
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Files section">
    In your Vapi dashboard, click `Files` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the spreadsheets">
    - Click `Choose file`. Upload all three CSV files: `leads.csv`, `products.csv`, and `call_outcomes.csv`.
    - Note the file IDs. We'll need them later to create tools.
  </Step>

## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our outbound sales workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **Node Name**: `opening_and_permission`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are Alex, a professional outbound sales representative for TechFlow Solutions.

    Start with: "Hi, this is Alex calling from TechFlow Solutions. I hope I'm catching you at a good time. I'm reaching out because I noticed your company might benefit from our workflow automation platform. Do you have just 2 minutes to chat?"

    Listen for their response and determine:
    - "permission_granted" if they agree to talk
    - "busy_reschedule" if they're busy but open to rescheduling
    - "not_interested" if they decline
    - "gatekeeper" if you're speaking to someone who isn't the decision maker

    Keep responses under 30 words and be respectful of their time.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `permission_status`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The prospect's response to the initial request`
    - Enum Values: `permission_granted`, `busy_reschedule`, `not_interested`, `gatekeeper`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Lead Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node that runs before the opening:
    
    **Tool**: Select your pre-configured "Lead Lookup" tool from the dropdown. This tool should be created in the **Tools** section of your dashboard with:
    - **Function Name**: `lookup_lead`
    - **Description**: "Retrieve lead information and call history"
    - **Parameters**: 
      - `lead_id` (string): Lead ID to lookup
    - **Server URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Permission-Based Routing">
    Create branching paths based on the prospect's response. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Discovery Questions Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `discovery_questions`
    - **Prompt**: `Great! I appreciate your time. To better understand how we might help, can you tell me about your current workflow challenges? Specifically, what manual processes are taking up most of your team's time?`

    **Reschedule Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `schedule_callback`
    - **Prompt**: `I completely understand. When would be a better time for a quick 5-minute conversation? I have availability tomorrow morning or afternoon.`

    **Objection Handling Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `handle_initial_objection`
    - **Prompt**: `I understand you might not be looking for new solutions right now. Can I ask what you're currently using for workflow automation? I might have some insights that could be valuable.`

    **Gatekeeper Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `gatekeeper_routing`
    - **Prompt**: `I appreciate you taking the call. I'm looking to speak with whoever handles software decisions or operations. Would that be you, or could you point me in the right direction?`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Flow Conditions">
    Connect the nodes with conditions for the LLM to interpret:

    **From opening_and_permission to discovery_questions**:
    - Condition: `{{ permission_status == "permission_granted" }}`

    **From opening_and_permission to schedule_callback**:
    - Condition: `{{ permission_status == "busy_reschedule" }}`

    **From opening_and_permission to handle_initial_objection**:
    - Condition: `{{ permission_status == "not_interested" }}`

    **From opening_and_permission to gatekeeper_routing**:
    - Condition: `{{ permission_status == "gatekeeper" }}`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Objection Handler">
    Create a global node that handles objections throughout the call:
    
    **Node Name**: `objection_handler`
    **Global Node**: `enabled = true`
    **Enter Condition**: `{{ objection_detected == true or negative_sentiment == true }}`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    I hear your concern, and that's completely valid. Many of our clients had similar thoughts initially. Let me address that specific point and see if we can find a solution that makes sense for your situation.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever an objection is detected, regardless of where they are in the sales conversation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Qualification Flow">
    For prospects who engage, add these qualification nodes:

    **BANT Qualification Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `bant_qualification`
    - Extract budget, authority, need, and timeline information

    **Lead Scoring Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that calls lead scoring API based on qualification responses

    **Qualification Results Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `route_by_score`
    - Route based on lead score (hot, warm, cold)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Value Proposition Flow">
    **Industry-Specific Pitch Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `tailored_pitch`
    - Present value proposition based on their industry and pain points

    **ROI Demonstration Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `show_roi`
    - Provide specific ROI examples and case studies

    **Demo Offer Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `offer_demo`
    - Propose a product demonstration meeting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Appointment Scheduling Flow">
    **Calendar Check Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that checks sales team calendar for available demo slots

    **Appointment Confirmation Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `confirm_appointment`
    - Confirm meeting details and send calendar invite

    **CRM Update Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that records call outcome and next steps in CRM
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Transfer and Follow-up Options">
    **Transfer to Sales Rep Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Transfer`
    - **Destination**: `+1-555-SALES-1` (your sales team number)

    **Schedule Follow-up Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `schedule_followup`
    - Set automated follow-up call for future date

    **End Call Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Hangup`
    - Use when prospect is not qualified or requests no further contact
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Configure Phone Number for Outbound Calls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Phone Numbers">
    Click `Phone Numbers` in the left sidebar of your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or Import Phone Number">
    - Click `Create Phone Number` for a new Vapi number, or
    - Click `Import Phone Number` to use your existing number from Twilio/Telnyx
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Outbound Settings">
    **Assistant**: Select your `Alex - Sales Agent` assistant
    **Workflow**: Ensure it's linked to your `TechFlow Sales Qualification Workflow`
    
    **Outbound Configuration**:
    - Enable outbound calling capabilities
    - Set caller ID name to "TechFlow Solutions"
    - Configure voicemail detection and handling
    - Set maximum call duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Outbound Calling">
    Use the Vapi API to initiate test outbound calls:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.vapi.ai/call \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "phoneNumberId": "your-phone-number-id",
        "customer": {
          "number": "+1234567890"
        },
        "assistantId": "your-assistant-id"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
