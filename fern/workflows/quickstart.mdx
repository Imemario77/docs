## Overview

Build a simple voice agent using Vapi's visual workflow builder that greets users, collects their information, and demonstrates core workflow concepts like variable extraction, conditional routing, and global nodes.

</Frame>

**Agent Capabilities:**
* Greet users and ask about their voice agent needs
* Extract and store user information (name and city)
* Use variables in dynamic responses
* Handle escalation to human agents at any point

**What You'll Build:**
* Multi-node conversation flow with branching logic
* Variable extraction and liquid template usage
* Global escalation nodes for human transfer
* End-call automation with natural conversation termination

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).

## Scenario

We will create a simple information-gathering agent that demonstrates the core features of Vapi's workflow builder. This agent will showcase conversation flow, variable extraction, and escalation patterns that form the foundation of more complex workflows.

---

## 1. Create a Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Vapi Dashboard">
    Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) and log in to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Workflows section">
    Click `Workflows` in the left sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new workflow">
    - Click `Create Workflow`.
    - Enter workflow name: `Information Gathering Demo`.
    - Select the blank template.
    - Click **Create Workflow**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Configure the Start Node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the conversation node">
    The blank template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Hey there!
    ```

    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    Ask users what kind of voice agent they want to build. Be friendly and conversational.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the basic setup">
    Click **Call** in the top right to test your initial setup. The agent should greet you and ask about voice agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can change the node type by selecting a different type from the dropdown at the top of the node configuration panel. For example, you can change the start node type to API Request to trigger an HTTP request as soon as the call is connected.
</Note>

## 3. Add Information Collection Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a second conversation node">
    - Click the **+** button below the first node
    - Select **Conversation Node**
    - Configure the new node:

    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    Acknowledge the user's voice agent use case, then ask for information about the user. Ask for their first name and what city they're in.
    ```

    **Extract Variables** (expand this section):
    - Variable 1:
      - Name: `first_name`
      - Type: `string`
      - Description: `the user's first name`
    - Variable 2:
      - Name: `city`
      - Type: `string`
      - Description: `the user's city`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the connecting edge">
    Click on the edge between the two nodes and configure:
    - **Condition**: `User describes their voice agent`
    - Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 4. Add Dynamic Response Node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a third conversation node">
    Add another **Conversation Node** with this prompt:

    ```txt
    Say "Thanks {{first_name}}, {{city}} is great!"

    Then say a few nice words about the {{city}}. Keep it brief. After that, ask the user if there's anything you can help with and help them, unless they no longer need help.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove the edge condition">
    Click on the edge leading to this node and:
    - Remove any condition text (leave it blank)
    - Click **Save**
    
    This allows automatic flow after the variables are extracted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 5. Add Global Escalation Node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a global node for human escalation">
    Add a new **Conversation Node** and configure:

    **Global Node**: Toggle this **ON**

    **Conversation Prompt**:
    ```txt
    Confirm that the user wants to speak to a human and ask them what would they like to talk to the human about.
    ```

    **Condition Prompt**:
    ```txt
    User wants to speak to a human
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add transfer call node">
    Add a **Transfer Call Node** below the global node:
    - **Destination**: Enter your phone number or `+1-555-DEMO-123`
    - Configure **Transfer Plan** with a brief summary message
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Developers can specify a phone number destination and a [transfer plan](/call-forwarding#call-transfers-mode), which lets them specify a message or a summary of the call to the person or agent picking up in the destination number before actually connecting the call.
</Note>

## 6. Add Call Termination

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an End Call node">
    Add an **End Call Node** at the end of your main flow:
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Alright, have a nice day!
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the final edge">
    Update the edge leading to the End Call node:
    - **Condition**: `User does not need any help`
    - Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 7. Test Your Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test the complete flow">
    Click **Call** in the top right to test your workflow:
    - Verify the greeting works
    - Test variable extraction by providing your name and city
    - Confirm the dynamic response uses your information
    - Test the global escalation by saying "I want to speak to a human"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review your workflow structure">
    Your final workflow should have:
    - **Start Node**: Greeting and use case inquiry
    - **Collection Node**: Information gathering with variable extraction
    - **Response Node**: Dynamic response using extracted variables
    - **Global Node**: Human escalation available from anywhere
    - **Transfer Node**: Routes to human agent when needed
    - **End Node**: Natural conversation termination
  </Step>
</Steps>
