## Overview

The **Assistant** node enables a persistent conversation with one of your configured assistants.

## Configuration

- **Select an Assistant** Use the dropdown to select a pre-configured assistant.

## Usage

Add **Assistant** nodes as leaf nodes to enable ongoing conversations with your configured assistants. Currently, Assistant nodes must be placed at the end of a workflow branch, as they don't support transitioning to other nodes. This means the conversation with the assistant will continue until either the user ends the call or the assistant reaches a natural conclusion point.

The assistant will use its configured system prompt while inheriting the transcriber and voice settings from the global workflow assistant.

<Note>
Assistant nodes are currently designed as terminal nodes - they cannot be connected to other nodes in the workflow. This means the conversation will remain with the assistant until the call ends. Future updates will add support for AI-powered conditional branching.
