## Overview

The **Gather** collects input from users during an interaction. It is used to capture variables that will be referenced later in your workflow.

## Configuration

Define one or more variables to gather from the user with:
- **Name:** A unique identifier.
- **Description:** Details about the expected input to help the LLM get the right information from the caller.
- **Data Type:** String, number, boolean, enum.
- **Required:** Mark whether the variable is required or optional.

## Usage

Use **Gather** to extract specific details from user responses—such as their name, email, or ZIP code—to inform subsequent steps in your conversation. The Gather node doesn't directly prompt users; instead, it analyzes the conversation history to find the requested information and will ask follow-up questions if the user's response isn't clear. Make sure to precede it with a [`Say`](/workflows/nodes/say) node that explicitly prompts the user for the information you want to gather.

To use an extracted string variable in a [`Conditional`](/workflows/edges/logical-conditions) branch, we recommend using the `enum` option. This ensures the extracted value will reliably match your conditions later in the workflow.
