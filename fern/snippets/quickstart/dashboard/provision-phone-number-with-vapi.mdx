The quickest way to secure a phone number for your assistant is to purchase a phone number directly through Vapi.

<Info>
  Ensure you have a card on file that Vapi can bill before proceeding, you can add your billing
  information in your dashboard at [dashboard.vapi.ai/billing](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/billing)
</Info>

Navigate to the "Phone Numbers" section & click the "Buy number" button:

We will use the area code `415` for our phone number (these are area codes domestic to the US & Canada).

<Info>
  Currently, only US & Canada phone numbers can be directly purchased through Vapi. Phone numbers in
  other regions must be imported, see our [phone calling](/phone-calling) guide.
</Info>

Click "Buy", after purchasing a phone number you should see something like this:

<Frame caption="Here we can attach an assistant to the number for inbound calls (or perform an outbound call, with a select assistant).">

The phone number is now ready to be used (either for inbound or outbound calling).
