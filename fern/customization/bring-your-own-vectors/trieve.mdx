# Using Trieve with Vapi

Vapi offers two ways to integrate with [Trieve](https://trieve.ai):

1. **Direct Integration**: Create and manage Trieve datasets directly through Vapi
2. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your Trieve API key to import your existing Trieve datasets into Vapi

## Direct Integration with Trieve

When using Trieve directly through Vapi, you can create and manage datasets, but they'll be tied to Vapi's account. This approach offers:

- Quick setup with minimal configuration
- Basic dataset management through Vapi's API
- Limited customization options

### Setting up Direct Integration

1. Navigate to the [Vapi dashboard credentials page](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/keys)
2. Add your Trieve API key from [Trieve's dashboard](https://dashboard.trieve.ai/org/keys)
3. Create a new knowledge base with Trieve as the provider:

```json
{
  "name": "my-trieve-kb",
  "provider": "trieve",
  "searchPlan": {
    "scoreThreshold": 0.2,
    "searchType": "semantic"
  },
  "createPlan": {
    "type": "create",
    "chunkPlans": [
      {
        "fileIds": ["file-123", "file-456"],
        "websites": ["https://example.com"],
        "targetSplitsPerChunk": 50,
        "rebalanceChunks": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## BYOK with Trieve (Recommended)

The BYOK approach offers more flexibility and control over your datasets. You can:

- Fully manage your datasets in Trieve's native interface
- Use Trieve's advanced features like:
  - Custom chunking rules
  - Search playground testing
  - Manual chunk editing
  - Website crawling
  - Dataset visualization

### Step 1: Set Up Trieve Dataset

1. Create an account at [Trieve](https://trieve.ai)
2. Create a new dataset using Trieve's dashboard
3. Add content through various methods:

#### Document Upload

- Upload documents directly through Trieve's interface
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD
- Configure chunking parameters:
  - Chunk size
  - Overlap
  - Split delimiters

#### Website Crawling

Trieve offers powerful website crawling capabilities:

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
  "configuration": {
    "maxPages": 100,
    "allowedDomains": ["yourdomain.com"],
    "excludePatterns": ["/admin/*", "/login"],
    "includePatterns": ["/docs/*", "/blog/*"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test and Refine

Use Trieve's search playground to:

- Test semantic search queries
- Adjust chunk sizes
- Edit chunks manually
- Visualize vector embeddings
- Fine-tune relevance scores

### Step 3: Import to Vapi

Once your dataset is optimized in Trieve, import it to Vapi:

```json
{
  "name": "trieve-byok",
  "provider": "trieve",
  "searchPlan": {
    "scoreThreshold": 0.2,
    "searchType": "semantic"
  },
  "createPlan": {
    "type": "import",
    "providerId": "<Your Trieve Dataset ID>"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Dataset Organization**

   - Keep datasets focused on specific topics
   - Use meaningful dataset names
   - Document your chunking configurations

2. **Content Quality**

   - Clean and preprocess documents before uploading
   - Review and edit chunks in Trieve's interface
   - Test search relevance before importing to Vapi

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Monitor chunk sizes (recommended: 200-1000 tokens)
   - Use appropriate search types for your use case
   - Adjust score thresholds based on testing

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regularly update content in Trieve
   - Monitor search performance
   - Keep API keys secure and updated

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Poor Search Results**

   - Adjust score threshold
   - Try different search types (semantic, hybrid, BM25)
   - Review chunk sizes and content quality

2. **Integration Issues**

   - Verify API keys are correct
   - Ensure dataset IDs are valid
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Performance Problems**
   - Reduce chunk sizes
   - Optimize search configurations
   - Consider splitting large datasets
