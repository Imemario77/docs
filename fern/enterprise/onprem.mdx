Vapi On-Prem allows you to deploy Vapi's best in class enterprise voice infrastructure AI directly in your own cloud. It can be deployed in a dockerized format on any cloud provider, in any geographic location, running on your GPUs.

With On-Prem, your audio and text data stays in your cloud. Data never passes through Vapi's servers. If you're are handling sensitive data (e.g. health, financial, legal) and are under strict data requirements, you should consider deploying on-prem.

Your device regularly sends performance and usage information to Vapi's cloud. This data helps adjust your device's GPU resources and is also used for billing. All network traffic from your device is tracked in an audit log, letting your engineering or security team see what the device is doing at all times.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Can the appliance adjust to my needs?

Yes, the Vapi On-Prem appliance automatically adjusts its GPU resources to handle your workload as required by our service agreement. It can take a few minutes to adjust to changes in your workload. If you need quicker adjustments, you might want to ask for more GPUs by contacting support@vapi.ai.

#### What if I can’t get enough GPUs from my cloud provider?

If you're struggling to get more GPUs from your provider, contact support@vapi.ai for help.

#### Can I access Vapi's AI models?

No, our AI models are on secure machines in your Isolated VPC and you can’t log into these machines or check their files.

#### How can I make sure my data stays within my cloud?

Your device operates in VPCs that you control. You can check the network settings and firewall rules, and look at traffic logs to make sure everything is as it should be. The Control VPC uses open source components, allowing you to make sure the policies are being followed. Performance data and model updates are sent to Vapi, but all other traffic leaving your device is logged, except for the data sent back to your API clients.
