The Call Analysis feature allows you to summarize and evaluate calls, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness. This feature uses a combination of prompts and schemas to generate structured data and success evaluations based on the call's content.

You can customize the below in the assistant's `assistant.analysisPlan`.

## Summary Prompt

The summary prompt is used to create a concise summary of the call. This summary is stored in `call.analysis.summary`.

### Default Summary Prompt

The default summary prompt is:

```text
You are an expert note-taker. You will be given a transcript of a call. Summarize the call in 2-3 sentences, if applicable.
```

### Customizing the Summary Prompt

You can customize the summary prompt by setting the `summaryPrompt` property in the API or SDK:

```json
{
  "summaryPrompt": "Custom summary prompt text"
}
```

To disable the summary prompt, set it to an empty string `""` or `"off"`:

```json
{
  "summaryPrompt": ""
}
```

## Structured Data Prompt

The structured data prompt extracts specific pieces of data from the call. This data is stored in `call.analysis.structuredData`.

### Default Structured Data Prompt

The default structured data prompt is:

```text
You are an expert data extractor. You will be given a transcript of a call. Extract structured data per the JSON Schema.
```

### Customizing the Structured Data Prompt

You can set a custom structured data prompt using the `structuredDataPrompt` property:

```json
{
  "structuredDataPrompt": "Custom structured data prompt text"
}
```

## Structured Data Schema

The structured data schema enforces the format of the extracted data. It is defined using JSON Schema standards.

### Customizing the Structured Data Schema

You can set a custom structured data schema using the `structuredDataSchema` property:

```json
{
  "structuredDataSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "field1": { "type": "string" },
      "field2": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["field1", "field2"]
  }
}
```

## Success Evaluation Prompt

The success evaluation prompt is used to determine if the call was successful. This evaluation is stored in `call.analysis.successEvaluation`.

### Default Success Evaluation Prompt

The default success evaluation prompt is:

```text
You are an expert call evaluator. You will be given a transcript of a call and the system prompt of the AI participant. Determine if the call was successful based on the objectives inferred from the system prompt.
```

### Customizing the Success Evaluation Prompt

You can set a custom success evaluation prompt using the `successEvaluationPrompt` property:

```json
{
  "successEvaluationPrompt": "Custom success evaluation prompt text"
}
```

To disable the success evaluation prompt, set it to an empty string `""` or `"off"`:

```json
{
  "successEvaluationPrompt": ""
}
```

## Success Evaluation Rubric

The success evaluation rubric defines the criteria used to evaluate the call's success. The available rubrics are:

- `NumericScale`: A scale of 1 to 10.
- `DescriptiveScale`: A scale of Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor.
- `Checklist`: A checklist of criteria and their status.
- `Matrix`: A grid that evaluates multiple criteria across different performance levels.
- `PercentageScale`: A scale of 0% to 100%.
- `LikertScale`: A scale of Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree.
- `AutomaticRubric`: Automatically break down evaluation into several criteria, each with its own score.
- `PassFail`: A simple 'true' if the call passed, 'false' if not.

### Customizing the Success Evaluation Rubric

You can set a custom success evaluation rubric using the `successEvaluationRubric` property:

```json
{
  "successEvaluationRubric": "NumericScale"
}
```

## Combining Prompts and Rubrics

You can use prompts and rubrics in combination to create detailed instructions for the call analysis:

```json
{
  "successEvaluationPrompt": "Evaluate the call based on these criteria:...",
  "successEvaluationRubric": "Checklist"
}
```

By customizing these properties, you can tailor the call analysis to meet your specific needs and gain valuable insights from your calls.
