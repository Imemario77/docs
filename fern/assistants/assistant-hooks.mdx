## Overview

Assistant hooks let you automate actions when specific events occur during a call. Use hooks to transfer calls, run functions, or send messages in response to events like call ending or speech interruptions.

Supported events include:

- `call.ending`: When a call is ending
- `assistant.speech.interrupted`: When the assistant's speech is interrupted
- `customer.speech.interrupted`: When the customer's speech is interrupted

You can combine actions and add filters to control when hooks trigger.

## How hooks work

Hooks are defined in the `hooks` array of your assistant configuration. Each hook includes:

- `on`: The event that triggers the hook
- `do`: The actions to perform (supports `transfer`, `function`, and `say`)
- `filters`: (Optional) Conditions that must be met for the hook to trigger

<Note>
The `call.endedReason` filter can be set to any of the [call ended reasons](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/calls/get#response.body.endedReason).  
The transfer destination type follows the [transfer call tool destinations](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/tools/create#request.body.transferCall.destinations) schema.
</Note>

## Example: Transfer on pipeline error

Transfer a call to a fallback number if a pipeline error occurs:

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "number",
        "number": "+1234567890",
        "callerId": "+1987654321"
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

You can also transfer to a SIP destination:

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [{
      "type": "transfer",
      "destination": {
        "type": "sip",
        "sipUri": "sip:user@domain.com"
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Example: Combine actions on pipeline error

Perform multiple actions—say a message, call a function, and transfer the call—when a pipeline error occurs:

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "call.ending",
    "filters": [{
      "type": "oneOf",
      "key": "call.endedReason",
      "oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]
    }],
    "do": [
      {
        "type": "say",
        "exact": "I apologize for the technical difficulty. Let me transfer you to our support team."
      },
      {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
          "name": "log_error",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "error_type": {
                "type": "string",
                "value": "pipeline_error"
              }
            }
          },
          "description": "Logs the error details for monitoring"
        },
        "async": true,
        "server": {
          "url": "https://your-server.com/api"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "transfer",
        "destination": {
          "type": "number",
          "number": "+1234567890",
          "callerId": "+1987654321"
        }
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## Example: Handle speech interruptions

Respond when the assistant's speech is interrupted by the customer:

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "assistant.speech.interrupted",
    "do": [{
      "type": "say",
      "exact": ["Sorry about that", "Go ahead", "Please continue"]
    }]
  }]
}
```

Handle customer speech interruptions in a similar way:

```json
{
  "hooks": [{
    "on": "customer.speech.interrupted",
    "do": [{
      "type": "say",
      "exact": "I apologize for interrupting. Please continue."
    }]
  }]
}
```

## Common use cases

- Transfer to a human agent on errors
- Route to a fallback system if the assistant fails
- Handle customer or assistant interruptions gracefully
- Log errors or events for monitoring

<Note>
Use `"oneOf": ["pipeline-error"]` as a catch-all filter for any pipeline-related error reason.
