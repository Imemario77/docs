## 4. Build the Workflow

You'll start with a default template that includes a "Call Start" node. We'll modify the existing nodes and add new ones to create our medical triage and scheduling workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure the Initial Conversation Node">
    The default template includes a conversation node. Click on it and configure:
    
    **First Message**:
    ```txt
    Hello, you've reached Riverside Family Clinic. This is Nurse Kelly, your medical assistant. I can help you schedule appointments, assess your symptoms, or direct you to appropriate care. How may I assist you today?
    ```
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    You are Nurse Kelly, a licensed medical assistant for Riverside Family Clinic.

    Listen to the patient's response and determine their primary need:
    - "symptoms" for medical concerns or illness
    - "appointment" for routine scheduling
    - "prescription" for medication refills
    - "emergency" for urgent medical situations
    - "general" for other inquiries

    Keep responses professional and under 30 words.
    ```

    **Extract Variables**:
    - Variable: `call_purpose`
    - Type: `String`
    - Description: `The patient's primary need`
    - Enum Values: `symptoms`, `appointment`, `prescription`, `emergency`, `general`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Patient Identification Node">
    Add a **Conversation** node:
    
    **Node Name**: `patient_identification`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    I'll need to verify your information first. Can you please provide your full name and phone number so I can look up your patient record?

    If this is for someone else, please let me know your relationship to the patient.
    ```

    **Variable Extraction**:
    - Variable: `patient_name`
    - Type: `string`
    - Description: `Patient's full name`
    - Required: `true`
    - Variable: `phone_number`
    - Type: `string`
    - Description: `Patient's phone number`
    - Required: `true`
    - Variable: `caller_relationship`
    - Type: `string`
    - Description: `Relationship to patient if calling for someone else`
    - Required: `false`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Patient Lookup Tool Node">
    Add a **Tool** node:
    
    **Tool**: Select your pre-configured "Patient Lookup" tool from the dropdown. This tool should be created in the **Tools** section of your dashboard with:
    - **Function Name**: `lookup_patient`
    - **Description**: "Look up patient record by ID"
    - **Parameters**: 
      - `patient_id` (string, required): Patient's ID number
    - **Server URL**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Purpose-Based Routing">
    Create branching paths based on the patient's needs. Add multiple conversation nodes:

    **Medical Triage Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `medical_triage_assessment`
    - **Prompt**: `I understand you're having some medical concerns. Let me ask you some questions to better assess your situation. What symptoms are you experiencing, and when did they start?`

    **Routine Appointment Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `routine_appointment_scheduling`
    - **Prompt**: `I can help you schedule an appointment. What type of visit do you need - routine check-up, follow-up, or something specific?`

    **Prescription Refill Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `prescription_refill_request`
    - **Prompt**: `I can help with your prescription refill. Which medication do you need refilled, and what's the name of the prescribing provider?`

    **Emergency Assessment Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `emergency_assessment`
    - **Prompt**: `I understand this may be urgent. Can you describe what's happening right now? Are you experiencing any chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe bleeding?`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Flow Conditions">
    Connect the nodes with conditions for the LLM to interpret:

    **From greeting_and_purpose to medical_triage_assessment**:
    - Condition: `{{ call_purpose == "symptoms" }}`

    **From greeting_and_purpose to routine_appointment_scheduling**:
    - Condition: `{{ call_purpose == "appointment" }}`

    **From greeting_and_purpose to prescription_refill_request**:
    - Condition: `{{ call_purpose == "prescription" }}`

    **From greeting_and_purpose to emergency_assessment**:
    - Condition: `{{ call_purpose == "emergency" }}`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Global Emergency Detection Node">
    Create a global node that monitors for emergency keywords throughout the call:
    
    **Node Name**: `emergency_detector`
    **Global Node**: `enabled = true`
    **Enter Condition**: `{{ emergency_keywords_detected == true or red_flag_symptoms == true }}`
    
    **Prompt**:
    ```txt
    I'm hearing some concerning symptoms. For your safety, I need to direct you to immediate medical care. Please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself - have someone else drive you or call an ambulance.
    ```
    
    This global node will activate whenever emergency keywords are detected, regardless of where they are in the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Triage Assessment Flow">
    For the medical triage path, add these nodes:

    **Symptom Collection Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `collect_symptoms`
    - Extract detailed symptom information, onset, severity

    **Triage Protocol Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that calls triage protocol API with symptom data

    **Urgency Classification Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `classify_urgency`
    - Determine urgency level: emergency, urgent, semi-urgent, routine
    - Route to appropriate care level
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Provider Availability Flow">
    **Provider Lookup Tool Node**:
    - Add a **Tool** node that checks available appointments based on urgency and specialty

    **Appointment Options Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `present_appointment_options`
    - Present available time slots to patient
    - Use conditional logic based on urgency level

    **Appointment Confirmation Node**:
    - **Node Name**: `confirm_appointment`
    - Confirm appointment details and provide instructions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Emergency Routing Options">
    **911 Routing Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Transfer`
    - **Destination**: `911`
    - Use for life-threatening emergencies

    **Urgent Care Transfer Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Transfer`
    - **Destination**: `+1-555-URGENT-1` (urgent care line)

    **Nurse Line Transfer Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Transfer`
    - **Destination**: `+1-555-NURSE-1` (triage nurse line)

    **End Call Node**:
    - **Node Type**: `Hangup`
    - Use when patient needs are resolved
  </Step>
</Steps>
