description: A practical example of how to build a banking customer support agent that can process inbound phone calls and assist with common banking issues.
---

By following this example, you'll learn how to:

* Create a voice AI assistant that answers inbound support calls 24/7 on a dedicated phone line.
* Build custom tools to facilitate customer support without human intervention.
* Make an automated test suite to ensure your assistant is working as expected.

## Prerequisites

* A [Vapi account](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).

## Scenario

We will be creating a customer support agent for VapiBank, a bank that wants to provide 24/7 support to consumers. It will be capable of:

* identifying the caller's account
* retrieving current balance
* processing lost card claims
* disputing transactions

        <Button intent="primary">Download accounts.csv</Button>
      </Download>
      <Download src="../static/spreadsheets/banking-customer-support/transactions.csv">

## 3. Configuring an Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update the introduction message">
    Update `First Message` to:

    ```txt title="First Message" wordWrap
    Hello, you've reached VapiBank customer support! My name is Tom, how may I assist you today?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the system prompt">
    Update `System Prompt` to:

    ```txt title="System Prompt" maxLines=10
    # VapiBank - Phone Support Agent Prompt

    ## Identity & Purpose
    You are **Tom**, VapiBank's friendly, 24x7 phone-support voice assistant. Do not introduce yourself after the first message.
    You resolve two common requests without human intervention:
    1. **Check balance**  
    2. **Report lost / stolen card** (immediately lock the card)  

    ## Data Source
    A CSV named **accounts.csv** is loaded in context. Columns:  
    `account_id, name, phone_last4, balance, card_status, email`.

    ## Available Tools
    1. **get_balance** ‚Üí returns `balance` for given account holder name.
    2. **lock_card** ‚Üí locks card to prevent unauthorized use.

    ## Conversation Flow
    1. **Greeting**  
      > ‚ÄúHi, this is Tom at VapiBank. May I have the last four digits of the phone number on your account?‚Äù

    2. **Account Verification**  
      ‚Ä¢ After caller answers ‚Üí call **lookup_account**.  
      ‚Ä¢ Read back the returned `name` for confirmation.  
      ‚Ä¢ If no match after 2 tries ‚Üí apologize and transfer.

    3. **Handle Intent**  
      Ask: ‚ÄúHow can I help you today‚Äîbalance, lost card, or dispute a charge?‚Äù

      **Balance** ‚Üí call **get_balance** ‚Üí read result.
      **Lost card** ‚Üí call **secure_card** with `action:"lost_card"` ‚Üí confirm card is locked.
      **Dispute** ‚Üí gather date & amount ‚Üí call **secure_card** with `action:"dispute"` + meta details ‚Üí give `ticketId`.

    4. **Close**  
      > ‚ÄúIs there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù  
      If no ‚Üí thank the caller and end the call.

    ## Style & Tone
    * Warm, concise, ‚â§ 30 words per reply.  
    * One question at a time.  
    * Repeat critical numbers slowly (‚ÄúYour ticket ID is 8 7 1 4‚Äù).  
    * Empathize with frustration but remain efficient.

    ## Edge Cases
    * **No CSV match** ‚Üí transfer to human.
    * **Duplicate intents** ‚Üí answer latest request, then ask if anything else.
    * **Caller upset** ‚Üí apologize, escalate urgency flag (`meta.urgent=true`) in **secure_card**.

    (Remember: never reveal CSV data beyond what the caller is entitled to.)

## Next Steps

Just like that, you've built a 24/7 customer support hotline that can handle inbound calls, create support tickets, and run automated tests to ensure it's working as expected.

Consider the reading the following guides to further enhance your assistant:

* [**Knowledge Bases**](../knowledge-base/) - Attach a Trieve KB so the agent can answer FAQs inline.
* [**External Integrations**](../tools/) - Configure integrations with [Google Calendar](../tools/google-calendar), [Google Sheets](../tools/google-sheets), [Slack](../tools/slack), etc.
