# API Retry and Concurrency Management

## Handling Retries
Retries are effective for API calls of short durations. For longer-running calls, such as those exceeding 10 minutes, ensure your retry intervals align with the call duration to prevent premature attempts or wasted resources.

## Concurrency Limits
The API enforces a concurrency limit, which governs the number of simultaneous API calls. When this limit is exceeded, the API responds with:
```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{
  "error": "Over Concurrency Limit"
}
```
## Avoiding Concurrency Limit Breaches

High volumes of outbound calls, especially when queued via the dashboard, can lead to hitting the concurrency cap. Follow these best practices to avoid such breaches:

- **Reduce simultaneous calls:** Minimize concurrent requests to keep within the limit.
- **Introduce delays:** Space out call initiations to manage traffic.
- **Optimize call durations:** Ensure calls complete efficiently to prevent queue overloads.

## Managing Concurrency Effectively

For enterprise plans, additional concurrency capacity can be purchased. Use the monitoring tools provided in the API dashboard to:

- **Track active call usage:** Monitor ongoing API requests to stay within limits.
- **Analyze and adjust thresholds:** Identify patterns and reconfigure settings as needed.
- **Reference your subscription schema for limit details:**
  - `Subscription.concurrencyLimitIncluded`: Default concurrency capacity.
  - `Subscription.concurrencyLimitPurchased`: Additional purchased capacity.

For more details, refer to the [Subscription schema](https://api.vapi.ai/api/).
