SIP is a signaling protocol used to initiate, manage, and terminate real-time communication sessions over IP networks, such as voice and video calls. It is essential for tasks like call setup, modification, and termination, enabling devices to connect and communicate efficiently within the network.

## Key Concepts

### Call Termination

- Call Termination refers to the process of routing outbound calls from one network to another, ensuring that calls reach their intended recipients. This is a critical component in completing calls across different telecommunication networks. Termination involves carrier agreements, quality of service considerations, and associated costs, particularly for international calls.

### Call Origination

- Call Origination is the process of receiving inbound calls on a network. This involves assigning and managing phone numbers, allowing users to receive calls from the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or other IP-based networks. Origination can include local or toll-free numbers, with calls routed to the recipient within the network or passed on for further processing.

## Setting Up SIP Calls

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Assistant">

We'll create an assistant with `POST /assistant` endpoint. This is no different than creating an assistant for other transports.

```json
{
	"name": "My SIP Assistant",
	"firstMessage": "Hello {{first_name}}, you've reached me over SIP."
}

```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a SIP Phone Number">

We'll create a SIP phone number with `POST /phone-number` endpoint. 

```json
{
	"provider": "vapi",
	"sipUri": "sip:your_unique_user_name@sip.vapi.ai",
	"assistantId": "your_assistant_id"
}

```

`sipUri` is the SIP URI of the phone number. It must be in the format `sip:username@sip.vapi.ai`. You are free to choose any username you like.

</Step>



<Step title="Start a SIP call">

You can use any SIP softphone to test the Assistant. Examples include [Zoiper](https://www.zoiper.com/) or [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/). 

You just need to dial `sip:your_unique_user_name@sip.vapi.ai` and the Assistant will answer your call. 

There is no authentication or SIP registration required.

</Step>

<Step title="Send SIP Headers to Fill Template Variables">


To fill your template variables, you can send custom SIP headers. 

For example, to fill the `first_name` variable, you can send a SIP header `x-first_name: John`. 

The header name is case insensitive. So, `X-First_Name`, `x-first_name`, and `X-FIRST_NAME` are all the same.

</Step>

<Step title="Use a Custom Assistant For Each Call">


You can use a custom assistant for SIP calls same as phone calls.

Set the `assistantId` to `null` and the `serverUrl` to the URL of your server which will respond to the `assistant-request`.

`PATCH /phone-number/:id`
```json
{
	"assistantId": null,
	"serverUrl": "https://your_server_url"
}
```

Now, every time you make a call to this phone number, the server will receive a `assistant-request` event.
