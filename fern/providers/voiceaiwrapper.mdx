## Overview

VoiceAIWrapper is the ultimate white-label platform built specifically for Vapi agencies. It transforms Vapi's powerful voice APIs into a comprehensive business platform with automated client onboarding, billing, and campaign management—all in 30 minutes instead of months of custom development.

## Key Benefits

- **30-Minute Setup:**
  Connect your Vapi API key and instantly sync all assistants, phone numbers, and knowledge bases. No coding required—just paste your credentials and start onboarding clients.

- **Complete White-Labeling:**
  Your domain, your logo, your colors, your support channels. Clients never see VoiceAIWrapper branding—it's your platform powered by our infrastructure.

- **Advanced Vapi Integration:**
  Deep integration with Vapi's full feature set including assistants, phone numbers, knowledge bases, and real-time webhook synchronization for seamless operation.

- **Automated Client Management:**
  SaaS Creator embed codes enable automated client onboarding and billing. Scale to 100+ clients without hiring additional staff.

- **Advanced Campaign Tools:**
  Built-in inbound/outbound workflows, smart callbacks, phone number pools, and real-time lead management via API integration.

- **Flexible Pricing Models:**
  Usage-based, subscription + overage, or voice minute packs. Markup Vapi costs with full transparency and automated Stripe billing.
